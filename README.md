# Lubuntu Arc-Round Openbox Theme

A small **redesign** of Lubuntu Round Openbox theme included in Lubuntu 20.04, perfect to combine with the Breeze and Arc themes.<br> 
With respect to the original version, the shape of the icons was changed to smaller ones (similar to the Arc theme) and a version suitable for ligth themes was added.
